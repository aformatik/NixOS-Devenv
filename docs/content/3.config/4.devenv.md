# flake.nix, devenv.sh, flox

## flake.nix

Because a code machine is just a NixOS machine with flakes enabled, even a empty code machine supports flakes per default (try `codchi init <NAME>` without args!). But you can use the configuration to provide tools which the flake doesn't provide:

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {

  # Direnv support
  direnv = {
    enable = true;
    enableBashIntegration = true;
    # use_nix and use_flake support
    nix-direnv.enable = true;
  };

  # See <https://codchi.dev/config/editor> on how to add an editor
}
```

## devenv.sh, flox

As described in [the intro](../1.introduction/0.what-is-codchi.md#when-should-i-not-use-codchi), Codchi doesn't try to do the job of tools like [devenv.sh](https://devenv.sh/) or [flox](https://flox.dev/). Instead, both can be used together, each for their respective purpose: Codchi provides a consistent environment across Windows and Linux and devenv.sh or flox provide the development environment itself.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {

  # For direnv support
  # direnv = {
  #   enable = true;
  #   enableBashIntegration = true;
  #   # use_nix and use_flake support
  #   nix-direnv.enable = true;
  # };

  environment.systemPackages = [
    pkgs.devenv
    # Or see <https://flox.dev/docs/install-flox/#install-flox-from-scratch> on how to install flox
  ];

  # See <https://codchi.dev/config/editor> on how to add an editor
}
```

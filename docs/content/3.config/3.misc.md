# Miscellaneous

## Welcome Message

When opening a shell into a code machine, the user is greeted with the following message:
```
❄️ Welcome to your code machine! ❄️

To get started with Codchi, read the docs at <https://codchi.dev/>.
If you encounter problems please open an issue at <https://github.com/aformatik/codchi/issues>.
```
To customize this, for example to give the user instructions on how to procceed further, there is [`codchi.welcome.text`](./99.Codchi specific NixOS Options.md#codchiwelcometext) and [`codchi.welcome.extraText`](./99.Codchi specific NixOS Options.md#codchiwelcomeextratext).

## Docker

Docker works normally in Codchi, but the user `codchi` has to be added to the corresponding group in order to not require `sudo`. Codchi provides the convenience option [`codchi.docker.enable`](./99.Codchi specific NixOS Options.md#codchidockerenable) for this.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  codchi.docker.enable = true;
}
```

## Time Zone

By default the time zone is UTC inside a code machine. You can change this via
```nix
{
    time.timeZone = "Europe/Berlin";
}
```

## Windows Networking

By default WSL configures the `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf` to match the networking settings of the host. Therefore they can't be generated by NixOS / Codchi. While Windows' DNS settings (through `/etc/resolv.conf`) are often neccessary for a working WSL instance, `/etc/hosts` is overridden by Codchi to enable reproducible IP / Domain configuration.

To override this change these options:
```nix
{
  environment.etc = {
    hosts.enable = true; # /etc/hosts set by Codchi
    "resolv.conf".enable = false; # /etc/hosts set by WSL
  };
}
```
